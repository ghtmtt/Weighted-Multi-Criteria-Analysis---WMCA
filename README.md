# Weighted-Multi-Criteria-Analysis---WMCA
Repository for the Weighted Multi-Criteria Analysis - WMCA QGIS Plugin

Displays rasterâ€™s pixels values to the user, making possible to assign weights for each raster and grades for each class within each raster. It was developed to perform weighted multi-criteria analysis, especially for environmental analyses like fragilities or favorabilities studies, environmental zoning and other types of zoning.


P.S.: Not working on the last version of QGIS(3.14).
